#  protagonist fox

the protagonist is a vixen of unspecified species.  she comes from a middle-class family, in a home where she lives with her mother and older brother.  she will not be named, at least not yet.  her description will always be vague and uncertain.  i want it this way for the player to be able to imagine her however they want.

initially she is shy and uncertain about attending an all-vixens school.  she is a little frustrated too, because she thinks she won't be able to have a high school relationship if she's surrounded by vixens only.  she often remembers a tod named [fill this in soon] from her middle school, who she had liked but never formed a proper romance with due to her shyness.

however, as the game progresses she becomes gayer and gayer until she finally ends up being with one of the vixens at her school.  she may or may not struggle with sexuality labels.

###  stats

protagvix will have a confidence stat influenced by her actions.

the actions may be saying particularly strong things (or doing) when available as a choice.  the choices for more bold actions will be sparse in the beginning but continue to pop up and be more relevant as confidence stat (from here now referred to as $con).

$con could also be influenced possibly by performing actions that are not particularly social in nature but make protagvix feel good.

these would increase $con in a range of 0.5 to 1.5, where more social-related $con-raising interactions would range from 3.0 to 5.0.
